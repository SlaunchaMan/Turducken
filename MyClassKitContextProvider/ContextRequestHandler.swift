        // one-time initialization.

        // If your extension is being called, an instructor is probably creating a Handout and actively
        // browsing for quizzes/activities. Your extension should try to update your context tree quickly.
        // Note: your call to -[CLSDataStore saveWithCompletion:] will likelty trigger a refresh of the
        // available quizzes/activities, so call it as soon as you can.
